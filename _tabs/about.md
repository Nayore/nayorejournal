## Welcome to NAYoRE's blog!

I'm just a student who finds languages funny. Although I've studied English (as a foreigner) for more than 10 years, today I've found out that I've used a word that doesn't exist for more than two years. The point is: have you ever been in the bogs of a British pub? You could find those naive large stainless steel urinals they sometimes use. Hopefully, they never forget to use those lemon-smelling yellow chunks. Don't ask me why, since the first time I had to find a word for those...*things*, I've always named them 'pastiches.' My mind went full heuristic monkey or something. 

Considering that I'm an Italian native speaker, I probably thought about the word   
>**Pasticca**
>
>Ital. Feminine noun, plur. pasticche; 'Tablet or pill'    

and I searched for a logic-sounding version in English ending up with pastiche, which btw exists in English, it's used in artistic subjects.

I've learned a new thing about English, but about the British too: they'll never correct you, allowing to create such miserable red herrings about words inside your brain. Tbh, I've always found languages funny because I learn about the speaker too. Living abroad, I noticed how I love to compare the different ways two languages use to express the same meaning or concept.   
Moreover, I'm kinda bored, I'm lazy and I need to set a routine or something. That's why I decided to keep this journal, where I jot down observations and my progress while trying to learn Japanese, another *pretty funny* language. Fingers crossed! 

I'm a MA Eng Lit student, Italian native but based in the UK. I guess I've tried to kill two or more birds with a stone and opened a blog to:
- record my 'progress' learning Japanese
- maybe finding a pen pal, so that I could train my horrible handwriting
- just because
