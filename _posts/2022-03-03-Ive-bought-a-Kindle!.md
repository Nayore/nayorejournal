## I've Bought a Kindle!

I hope nobody thought I'd have spoken only of Japanese stuff. God, I'm not obsessed at that point, what do you think?

Anyway, this happened exactly when I started the blog for the first time, the first of March, *anno* freaking *Domini* 2022. I wanted to write about it during that day, but writing a markdown file for jekyll and github is a mess! I'll write about this, in the future, maybe.

As always, I'll write a premise first: it's my second time purchasing an e-reader, but my first choice was kinda unfortunate and deprecating: a Nook(link to a picture of a Nook). I think it has all the possible defects: it's chunky, its margins are too big, it relies on a touch screen, but this is horrendous as it lags too much. But this new thing, omg, made me shiver a bit. Amazon crafted it really well. It doesn't have a touch screen, but they have ingenuously put buttons on the sides, and they work quite well. I've traded it for an old NVIDIA GT-730 that was gathering dust at CEX. I was astonished when they paid me 20 quid (on voucher, not cash) and I was literally ascended when I found this Kindle 4 for 25 quid(It was branded as Kindle 5, shame on you CEX :angry: ).

*Kindle in operation - I was doing some good old hacking on it.*

Although all the time spent on writing markdown, I found time to set it up to transform it into a cutting-edge e-reader. I even changed the screensaver :100:

*The new screensaver - that's quite an improvement!*

Forgive me father, for I have sinned. But now I'm so happy with it! I've tried to convert [this scientific paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) using [k2pdfopt](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) to read it properly on the reader. You must play a bit with options, buut the [results]({{ site.url }}/assets/20220303/results.jpg) are astonishing! I also banged my head on the wall while trying similar programs for a novel but in the end, k2pdfopt seemed the best option to me.

The Mobileread forum offers a lot of documentation on how to tweak it. Finding their stuff the first time is difficult, and reading through their guide is a genuinely sloppy experience(there is too much back and forth), but they have everything one needs. Sometimes I could also stop minding my own business and writing about this.

What else? Right, I've finally received Gibson's *Neuromancer*.[^1] Seems quite interesting. I've also discovered Lem's *Solaris*, bought it without even thinking. I'll let you know!
