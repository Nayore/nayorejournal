#### What is this?

Among all the sorts of imperatives David Shields reminds us, there is this one

> —praise for matter in its simple state, as a fact.[^1] 


The description of single events or facts is what the human mind craves. Victorian society believed in a superhuman order which assured stability, the same stability through which events in British novels flow uninterrupted and ineluctable, from the beginning of the protagonist's life until its recount from the protagonist itself. British novelists developed their own techniques to reflect this order. We don't believe in any order anymore(not the *superhuman ones* at least,) so we don't use those techniques any longer. Fragements satisfy us even more.

Then, I'll leave my own fragments here. Maybe I'll keep this updated.

##### *17-03-2022*
- Yesterday a tiny and dark brown spider scared the shit out of me, dangling in front of my face from a cloth, to the extent that someone heard me swearing in Italian for a whole minute. I eventually left the spider outside, although I believe it was so more frightened than me that it simply laid still on a company garden pathway. I though it'd have recovered quickly enough to leave and continue its own life, but I think it simply laid until some employee squashed it with their moccasins. Poor spider. :cry: 
- I spoke about Dante's *Divine Comedy* to a Chinese friend of mine. He read some parts of the plot and told me about a Chinese Buddhist writer who wrote about the same kind of journey.
- I should write some posts about some meme-wave thing. An idea that intrigues me regards the *bruh moment*.
-  I've got the impression for a whole hour that my peripheral vision was somehow damaged. Am I hypochondriac-ish to such an extent? Nah, come on :relieved: ...UNLESS :flushed: 

> - And never say of anything "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," except [when adding], "If God wills." (Arab. **In šāʾ Allāh**)[^2]
> - "HEAVEN helps those who help themselves," is a well-tried maxim. [^3]

##### *27-03-2022*
- Today I was on a plane when the power button of my [Kindle](https://nayorejournal.github.io/posts/Ive-bought-a-Kindle!/) decides to go kaputt. Fortunately, I bought a book from a service station. I started reading it, but I was pissed af, since there were my uni book on that Kindle. 
- Around 2000 a Chinese girl, Zhang Xiangbi, who was carrying a child, tried to refuse some avances from an Italian grease monkey. He bashed her up and when she fainted he cut her throat before dumping her into a pit. This happened in Italy, in the metropolitan area of Naples, a place oppressed by the [Camorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra).[^4] What a shitty place is this world.

- みんなのに日本人よ、 聞いてください 英語を勉強してください。 難しいする 分かりますけど、 全部のこころえ開放するだとおもう。 
- 花澤香菜に 。 二日から妄想♡エクスプレスを聞きますよ。 千石撫子の展開に NISIOISINとシナリオライターと演出家 感謝の言葉もないが、他が花澤為にありますね 。千石は 全部の戦いとか展開過ぎに決心が 声為に あります 。素敵なあるともういます 。驚嘆します。
