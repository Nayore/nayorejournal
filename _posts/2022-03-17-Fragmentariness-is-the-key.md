#### What is this?

Among all the sorts of imperatives David Shields reminds us, there is this one

> —praise for matter in its simple state, as a fact.[^1] 


[^1]: *Reality Hunger: A Manifesto* (London: Penguin Books, 2011), p. 49.

The description of single events or facts is what the human mind craves. Victorian society believed in a superhuman order which assured stability, the same stability through which events in British novels flow uninterrupted and ineluctable, from the beginning of the protagonist's life until its recount from the protagonist itself. British novelists developed their own techniques to reflect this order. We don't believe in any order anymore(not the *superhuman ones* at least,) so we don't use those techniques any longer. Fragements satisfy us even more.

Then, I'll leave my own fragments here. Maybe I'll keep this updated.

##### *17-03-2022*
- Yesterday a tiny and dark brown spider scared the shit out of me, dangling in front of my face from a cloth, to the extent that someone heard me swearing in Italian for a whole minute. I eventually left the spider outside, although I believe it was so more frightened than me that it simply laid still on a company garden pathway. I though it'd have recovered quickly enough to leave and continue its own life, but I think it simply laid until some employee squashed it with their moccasins. Poor spider. :cry: 
- I spoke about Dante's *Divine Comedy* to a Chinese friend of mine. He read some parts of the plot and told me about a Chinese Buddhist writer who wrote about the same kind of journey.
- I should write some posts about some meme-wave thing. An idea that intrigues me regards the *bruh moment*.
-  I've got the impression for a whole hour that my peripheral vision was somehow damaged. Am I hypochondriac-ish to such an extent? Nah, come on :relieved: ...UNLESS :flushed: 

> - And never say of anything "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," except [when adding], "If God wills." (Arab. **In šāʾ Allāh**)[^2]
> - "HEAVEN helps those who help themselves," is a well-tried maxim. [^3]
