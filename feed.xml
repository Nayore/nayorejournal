What fetches you there and here spinning like a record 🎵 All I know is that to me You look like you’re havin’ fun Suppose you’re listening to one of those majestic perfomances of Ronald Reagan speaking about Soviets’, about their ‘cynicism’ and their sense of humour.

Among all the sorts of imperatives David Shields reminds us, there is this one —praise for matter in its simple state, as a fact.1 The description of single events or facts is what the human mind craves. Victorian society believed in a superhuman order which assured stability, the same stability through which events in British novels flow uninterrupted and ineluctable, from... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Goodbye, you old friend</title><link href="https://nayorejournal.github.io/posts/Goodbye-you-old-friend/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Goodbye, you old friend" /><published>2022-03-14T15:37:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-03-14T15:46:42+00:00</updated> <id>https://nayorejournal.github.io/posts/Goodbye-you-old-friend/</id> <content src="https://nayorejournal.github.io/posts/Goodbye-you-old-friend/" /> <author> <name>Nayore</name> </author> <category term="Youtube" /> <category term="Vanced" /> <summary> I actually wanted to write again about me reading Yotsuba-to(spoiler I haven’t read further then the first chapter) but here we go What’s happened? Yesterday the development of Youtube Vanced(which means “Advanced but without Ad”) has been interrupted by their devs, who declared they’ve been forced to shut it down. It’s easy to make some assumptions about who has forced them to do so.

The drawback is that you don’t know what to fuck talk about. I haven’t got used to it, I guess. I’m also not in the mood. I’m a bit depressed because of my work situation.

God, I’m not obsessed at that point, what do you think? Anyway, this happened exactly when I started the blog for the first time, the first of March, anno freaking Domini 2022. I wanted to write about it during that day, but writing a markdown file for jekyll and github is a mess! I’ll write about this, in the future, maybe. As alw... </summary> </entry> </feed>
