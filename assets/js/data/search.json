I can’t tell that for an American maybe, but I can totally suppose this kind of jokes is what has shaped in Americans their idea of the Soviet, still proud but tired of…being a communist? Being because of being communist? Anyway, that kind of skepticism and ‘sense of tiredness’ typical of the soviet is actually shared with many many European countries. :sparkles: Žižek :sparkles: 1 telling of Slovenian cynicism (the story during the first minute) is a good example. Already in 1885 someone on the Lippincott’s Magazine noticed how ‘the Sicilian […] reverses the golden rule in “who does it to thee, do it to him”’ thanks to Pitré’s studies.2 What Reagan has portrayed in his jokes was not only the Soviet, it was the Europeans themselves. At least, the poor ones.What I want to highlight nonetheless is that Reagan repeated those jokes again and again. That’s how any kind of object (or subject if it pleases) remains mesmerised in the minds of Americans at that period. Not because of the form, not because of the content, but because it has been repeated.What are we seeing right now? Nothing but repetitions. Of the exact same concept but for one scope and the same reversed. Have you heard :sparkles: Žižek :sparkles: comments on the Russia Ukraine conflict? That’s melody to me. 🎼You can have that kind of realization while doing your squats and listening to Reagan’s jokes. Do they matter? Not really. Unless you repeat them. Repetition is important. Covid has been important to the extent numbers, cases, anecdotes, fights and debates have been held and shown to the public continuosly. Because Covid is important. Media must remember you that Covid is important, but not that Pfizer’s revenue has more than doubled between 2020 and 2021. Which is not surprising, and it’s not even bad news per se, but becomes a bit weird when you notice that Pfizer’s been considered the worst trusted drug company in 2018. In 2018, worst trusted company; in 2019 first company who releases a messenger RNA vaccine, althought together with BioNTech. Attention, you little moppetsI’m not saying that everything have been made up, nor that the last pandemic or the virus itself don’t exist. I’d offend those who have mourned relatives and friends’ death, and I have some acquaintances among these. Plus, I’d definitely appear like a clown. 🤡 What I’m saying is that economic interests exist, and entrepreneurs do sometimes the worst shit to protect them. These are elements usually hidden from the media. Which makes sense, since what happens in companies is usually private. But maybe it shouldn’t be like that if the results of Pfizer’s businesses are inoculated in one of my (and your) arms? Even worser, if my (and your) ability to move freely around any country depends on that inoculation? What’s private here right now is literally not private any longer.Fun fact: did you know that the term privacy appeared for the first time in the The Burgh Court book of Selkirk in 1534? What intrigues me more is the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary puts forward that it may appear there as a ‘scribal error’ for privity3. Which is fun. Privity comes(as etymologists claim about privacy today) from the English adjective private, which in turn comes from Latin prīvātus, meaning ‘peculiar to oneself, special, individual, (noun) person who holds no public office’ or ‘close, intimate.’3 Thus, our concept of not being influenced or disturbed by the public or the government goes arm in arm with our sense of entrepreneurship. Isn’t that maybe a bit weird? Maybe that’s what pushes mass media not to mind Pfizer and others’ businesses. Maybe that’s what needs to change, what we need to disrupt. Entrepreneurship, I mean; not privacy. I find privacy a dull concept. Every company repeats ‘your privacy is important to us.’ Hell I bet it is so. Thanks to Peter Welch I now know the truth: Here are the secret rules of the internet: five minutes after you open a web browser for the first time, a kid in Russia has your social security number. Did you sign up for something? A computer at the NSA now automatically tracks your physical location for the rest of your life. Sent an email? Your email address just went up on a billboard in Nigeria.Anonymity sounds more important to me. It’s what I’m doing here, I’m not speaking privately(I’m mentioning private aspects of my life in the headlines of this post), but anonymously.Well, maybe not completely. My intent is to share my voice with you. I want to do it in an anonymous way so that my ideas can remain unfiltered from the expectations of those who know me at university or at work. Unfortunately, to share some opinion on a blog online, this blog must be indexed on google search engine. To do that the in the quick way4 I’ve linked my personal account on google with this blog’s domain. I can speak freely here about whatever I want, however Google can link every word I write here with my full name, my other personal details, my telephone number, my debit card. I’m not saying it’s doing it, but I’m saying it could materially happen. That’s because Google can and does protect its own privacy, to the extent that the public must not know how Google operates with users’ data. My personal, private details and my interest in anonymity are nullifed by Google’s rights to privacy. So the concept of privacy has made a full circle turning in a instrument to potentially nullify others’ privacy and anonymity. Google and other big companies have got Privacy(with a capital P) while its users got only a fake form of privacy. In this post of mine, I’ve written ‘Google, you piece of shit. I hate you.’ Everyone can read that sentence of mine, but nobody can link that sentence to me, to my name or to my details. Nobody, but Google.5 If sometimes Google decided to block contactless payments from my phone, officially because of their sublime excuse about security requirements(my phone is rooted because I do whatever I want to my phones, bitches) but in reality because an unknown bloke in Google has decided to personally attack me, I’d not be able to do anything apart from sucking it up. Is this fine? ☝️ I don’t think so. ☝️What else?I’m not really sure if I managed to explain in what a trip could consist. I suppose it depends on what we consider as an explanation. These realizations are what make the experience unique. They weren’t the only one I got during the trip. I for example noticed that there is a dark blue dick-shaped wave on Hokusai’s Great Wave (it’s at the bottom on the left, go check it). What I can give you right now it’s a glimpse of what a trip makes you realises. These are accompanied by an uncontrollable excitement. Saying you become frenetic is not enough. It’s even hard to imagine that I could write all of this during the trip. Have I crafted it later? Does this new element make all this wot fictional rather than true? My realisations could be unique and I could be the only one to experience them. You are now an exception, since you share some of this knowledge. I love you all.

Victorian society believed in a superhuman order which assured stability, the same stability through which events in British novels flow uninterrupted and ineluctable, from the beginning of the protagonist’s life until its recount from the protagonist itself. British novelists developed their own techniques to reflect this order. We don’t believe in any order anymore(not the superhuman ones at least,) so we don’t use those techniques any longer. Fragements satisfy us even more.Then, I’ll leave my own fragments here. Maybe I’ll keep this updated.17-03-2022 Yesterday a tiny and dark brown spider scared the shit out of me, dangling in front of my face from a cloth, to the extent that someone heard me swearing in Italian for a whole minute. I eventually left the spider outside, although I believe it was so more frightened than me that it simply laid still on a company garden pathway. I though it’d have recovered quickly enough to leave and continue its own life, but I think it simply laid until some employee squashed it with their moccasins. Poor spider. :cry: I spoke about Dante’s Divine Comedy to a Chinese friend of mine. He read some parts of the plot and told me about a Chinese Buddhist writer who wrote about the same kind of journey. I should write some posts about some meme-wave thing.

Fortunately, I bought a book from a service station. I started reading it, but I was pissed af, since there were my uni book on that Kindle. Around 2000 a Chinese girl, Zhang Xiangbi, who was carrying a child, tried to refuse some avances from an Italian grease monkey.

It’s easy to make some assumptions about who has forced them to do so. Google, you piece of shit. I hate you.Don’t get me wrongI still consider Youtube one of the greatest resources of this fucking dying internet. Half of my skills come from it. I’ve felt a sensation of pure fear for a sec when I heard Tom Scott claiming Youtube will be probably shut down in the future. It’s a pity though the company that’s behind it has become one the worst consuming cancer of this beautiful place Internet was once. They’ve become, together with Apple and few others, the materialisation of once abstract ideologies.1 They act like pussies. They’ve lost all their temper because of youtube-dl(which works thanks to a public youtube functionality for which Google has done nothing but crying out) and they have received that slap in the face they deserved. I won’t even talk about the dislike button thing. They’ve got all the money of this planet, but they still pretend to be in need of those pain-in-the-ass video ads of 30 seconds which you cannot even skip anymore.2 You could skip those horrible ads thanks to Youtube Vanced. You could also skip the sponsors parts directly while watching. Simply…It wasn’t all puppy dogs and rainbowsThis post will contain some criticism towards Vanced as well. Ffs, installation at the beginning worked through the .apks format, which are used by devs only (that’s why such method is totally a meme to me). Moreover, they’ve always got problem on MIUIs, and only recently their manager started to work fine for real. Anyway, any kind of this struggle is in vain now.Nonetheless, thank you VancedYou’ve been of great company during my researches for my phone personalisations. In the very end, you made Youtube on phones enjoyable and easy.What now?NewPipe seems the most suitable candidate to supply for such loss. It works with no frameworks from Google or Youtube, it simply scrapes pages and returns it what you need from a Youtube video. This should be enough not to see even this project being forcibly shut down. Maybe, thanks to SponsorBlock, users won’t even need an app: a mobile browser with a normal adblocker and this plugin should remove the unimportant content. Christians, Puritans, Quakers, Muslims, Protoalfabetabodhysattivationzsims - and the list can go on, could be once distinguished just according to their beliefs and the rituals developed from these. Their thoughts were shaped by years of predications from a different book(no matter if it’s the torah, the bible, the qur’an or the sutras) and they acted differently according to these predications. Now we simply got IOs vs Android…and maybe the new Huawei system? I don’t know, it’s a war between losers I don’t care. &amp;#8617; Remember, all these norms, regulations and discontinuations happen because Google gets ultimatums from ads companies when they claim they don’t receive enough money or they prefer to take distances from a specific content(this was the reason why all the demonetisation matter started, for example). &amp;#8617; " }, { "title": "&quot;Everything he sees is just blue&quot;", "url": "/posts/Everything-he-sees-is-just-blue/", "categories": "Japan, Exchange, Teaching, program, JET, housing, crisis, London, Birmingham, UK, GP, PhD, MA, mental, health, Basaglia, law", "tags": "", "date": "2022-03-08 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "The advantage of writing a post on a recently opened blog is that you can face whatever issue you’d like to focus on, without any restraint, lacking any fear towards an audience that is not yet established. The drawback is that you don’t know what to fuck talk about. I haven’t got used to it, I guess. I’m also not in the mood. I’m a bit depressed because of my work situation. I live in Birmingham, which tries to mimic London as closely as possible. They create traffic jams and throw tons of stainless steel beams on tons of concrete on every single suitable plot the council manages to find. To do what? To let speculators build high-luxury edifices with gym equipment and lounges. Who knows, it could end up like in London, where there is a rising number of people searching for home while the number of unoccupied flats also goes up because, breaking news, they are too expensive.Anyway, focusing back on Birmingham…more than one million people live here. One can obviously find a job, but you must adapt yourself, doing something that doesn’t reflect your studies or your interests, risking losing the chance to find what suits you. Let’s be honest, once you find a job, there will always be more reasons to keep it than to lose it. In the foreseeable future things seem only to get worse.It must be said that I’m one of those nagging blokes who are never content. I’ve been behind a counter in Italy for five years, but working as a salesman is the worst. Customers are the worst. I top-up my wage here, but I’m pretty tired to do it. I’ve been proposed an apprenticeship by an organization that qualifies new teachers. Such apprenticeship would overlap with my master’s though. Moreover, tbh, I’m interested in university, not in colleges or schools. But, to accomplish this I need to finish a PhD after my MA. I was working on the proposal, but I got a lot of setbacks: writing for this blog, learning python even, since I’m a crazy troublemaker.Let’s imagine I finish my PhD: then what? The situation in universities is not great either anymore. Graduate and post-graduate level jobs in music and the arts are missing, and Borish Johnson doesn’t want to fix this problem, rather make these disciplines disappear. But I’m a thrifty person: if I’m happy with my job I’ll accept even the minimum wage. Still, no jobs. What to do about it? A friend of mine reminded me last week how difficult getting by ‘writing books’ is. I agreed with him, although I added that I’m more interested in university. He replied: ‘you’re Italian, just sell perfumes.’ It was a bit of a shock…not because of the cliché of Italians selling perfumes, I couldn’t care more about that. I prefer an honest ‘guinea pig’ to an insincere smile. It was more a realisation.Let’s add for a sec Japan in all this rant. Another option I have is the Japan Exchange and Teaching program(or JET). Basically, whoever has a degree in English can propose themselves as a teacher assistant and - well, be provided with room and board and some money in Japan. I’ve thought a lot about this option, but there are drawbacks as well. The Japanese council specifies applicants must be nationals of the country from which they apply. Just this element is enough to force me to defer this option indefinitely: I should move back to Italy. Doing so the SLC, which has funded my uni courses, would wink at me and start asking insistently for their money back. Chances are that the money from the program would not suffice my personal expenses and the repayments. But you know what, I could also search for something else in Japan! Most easily said than done, since the only kind of job that I would find in the short term would be…waiter in an Italian restaurant or selling perfumes.ffsSince my mood is black in this period, it can’t be helped: rethinking about my friend’s words I tell myself: ‘why not go for it? Why would I strive for a PhD? Isn’t just finding a routine better? Not thinking about what to do, but about doing something. What if everyone tells you you’ve got all the choices available on Earth but you feel it doesn’t worth any longer?’ I’ve always trusted my curiosity about the world and humankind, but I was not prepared to lose my resilience in this way.I know I’m raving, but this is the last thing I can do. Just because I’m writing here. Am I raving anyway? Naah, more like I’m :sparkles: expressing myself. :sparkles: Everything now is about expressing yourself! It’s the motto of the 21st century - except that nobody’s gonna listen to you anyway. I’ve got some experience about it.You can have mental health support in companies nowadays because it’s important that you feel assisted and cared for, but not that you feel simply better. Change my mind. When I was diagnosed with clinical depression last year, I expressed the urge for sessions with a psychologist, because I felt something in my thoughts was wrong and twisted. I’m not afraid to say it, it’s a fact, more common than one can imagine. Anyway, my GP arranged sessions with a…consultant, who was brave enough to make me draw circles on a piece of paper like this to make me aknowledge that ‘I can’t have control over everything.’ Even better, he made me once close my eyes imagining that everything around me was red, then orange and then - well, the rest of the rainbow, to blue. He reminded me of this song. Has medicine gone too far?You ask for mental help, they give you sketches pads, meditation and quotations to Eurodance songs from the 90s. Pardon my French, but I don’t celebrate the Basaglia Law for this shit.I will expand more on this idea of mine about society being simply too hypocritical today. But for the moment I’m tired of seeing blue everywhere.

I wanted to write about it during that day, but writing a markdown file for jekyll and github is a mess! I’ll write about this, in the future, maybe.As always, I’ll write a premise first: it’s my second time purchasing an e-reader, but my first choice was kinda unfortunate and deprecating: a Nook(link to a picture of a Nook). I think it has all the possible defects: it’s chunky, its margins are too big, it relies on a touch screen, but this is horrendous as it lags too much. But this new thing, omg, made me shiver a bit. Amazon crafted it really well. It doesn’t have a touch screen, but they have ingenuously put buttons on the sides, and they work quite well. I’ve traded it for an old NVIDIA GT-730 that was gathering dust at CEX. I was astonished when they paid me 20 quid (on voucher, not cash) and I was literally ascended when I found this Kindle 4 for 25 quid(It was branded as Kindle 5, shame on you CEX :angry: ).Kindle in operation - I was doing some good old hacking on it.Although all the time spent on writing markdown, I found time to set it up to transform it into a cutting-edge e-reader.

But anyway - languages, which I say are funny; oh, and Japanese, which I say it’s really funny. Let’s start from my situation with it, how poor my Japanese is.1 I’ve studied Japanese completely on my own in a period of two years, stopping a lot and for a lot of time. I’ve obviously watched animes for an embarassingly huge portion of my life, so I can easily sense some meaning few times, especially linking them with sound or more or less accurate expressions, not to mention the short dictionary that every weeb develop.2 I’ve got some upper hands, since Italian phonetic system is pretty similar to Japanese, my pronunciation isn’t a problem. The problem is the writing system.Japanese writing systemThe Japanese use three writing systems: two syllabic alphabets, called Hiragana and Katakana, plus a group of ideograms, called Kanji. Unless your mnemonical skills are way worser than mine(and that’s rare), you can learn the alphabets easily, and learning them properly is useful to practise on words pronunciation. Kanji, well…that’s another story. These are quite nicely written kanji. My handwriting is way worseWriting Kanji is a mess, remembering them is a mess, since there are a lot of them.3 What I found really illuminating about them is that you can avoid mnemonically learning all of them, like the Japanese do in school. Kanji are composed of at most 214 radicals. They can be composed of only one or more radicals. Once learnt these, you can learn the stroke order, so that when you find a new kanji that you haven’t seen before you can: count the number of strokes used to write the whole kanji identify the first radical and its number of strokes go to jisho.org, open the radicals menu, search in the list(that’s indexed according to the number of strokes for each radical) for the first radical select it, and then search in the top list for your kanji, knowing its total number of strokes(Example needed? Example granted! :))Let’s consider this ideogram: 好You can find it in words like 好き(suki, to like) or お好み(okonomi, choice). It’s composed by the radical for woman, and the radical for child. Both are composed by three strokes, so the kanji totally counts six strokes. Let’s search for the woman radical (notice the highlights). Once selected, the top list is updated and you can find your kanji (notice the highlights). And it’s done!What else?I know the basics, like every weeb willing to learn japanese, thanks to the emblematic :sparkles: Itazuraneko’s sources :sparkles: but also thanks to some other language books in Italian(which can be useful to learn expressions and words, but the basic grammar is more easily explained by Itazuraneko). But in this period I’m pretty lazy, so I decided I should go for something different. So, I went for the other common choice: reading Yotsuba To!For those who don’t know, it’s a manga written by Azuma Kiyohiko, and it’s about a quirky and lively 5 years old girl. Let’s have a look at the first page. Following the classic manga-reading order,4 I can immediately say that the first three panels are absolutely fine. I know もうすぐだぞ loosely means ‘we’ve arrived.’ Fourth panel: I loved experimenting on reading すげえ as she would, and I don’t think I was really troubled by the ‘voice-over’ balloon(because that’s voice-over, I don’t think she would switch from すげえ to… that). If you’re not familiar with names abbreviations among relatives,5 you could easily miss that よーちゃん (yo-chan) is an abbreviation for Yotsuba, the protagonist’s name. That sentence anyway didn’t sound goood to me at first. If I should translate it without any kind of adaptation, I’d say ‘Yotsuba is full of this place!’ After searching for いっぱい (ippai) on Jisho, I see that いっぱいあるな could mean ‘being completely brimmed with (an emotion or a quality)’. I think it can be rendered as ‘Yo-chan is totally (focused) on this place!’ Then he says ‘Oh right, there is also a shop,’ and she makes a screaming cat call like ‘EVEN THE SHOP?!’ in turn.I’ve read some other pages but - I must get used to write these posts, I’ll call it a day. Noice! Fun fact. I’ve read this expression (‘I’m sorry my English is poor’) quite often on the Internet, in youtube section comments or some weird chan, but I’ve always found it slightly awkward. Jeez, ‘I’m not fluent in language x’ goes way better. &amp;#8617; If you want to make a Japanese laugh, just randomly utter okane! (o like in hospital , a like in hat, e like in pet but even more open if you can), with this hand gesture; it worked for me &amp;#8617; Japanese Kanji originally consisted of something around 50.000 ideograms.
